# AWS TechU 
## AWS Flashcard Game

### Origin
This project 'AWS Flash' was developed in response to the challenge of making a relatively simple Pyhton script demonstrating what we had learned in AWS TechU class. The game was orignially shared with the cohort in a Google CoLabs editor for the most accessibility and to help individuals study Amazon Web Service (AWS) terms and services. Individuals in the cohort were encouraged to add to and moderate the answer/clue dictionary to increase game accuracy and scope, and you are too! The Google CoLab can be found here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1o7EtYBfJYssWBgTq9NG1tlIahQ57V8Zl?usp=sharing#scrollTo=mwS1cVmYsEde

### Description
Once the game is initialized, terms within the specified dictionary are selected at random and clues for each term are provided at random. Correct answers will advance in the game while incorrect answers will be given multiple opportunities to answer correctly until all clues for said term are exhausted. Answer the questions pertaining to each clue to win!
